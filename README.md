# Projects/Assignments from the class "American Economic Mobility". 

## Dubois Project

An assignment to recreate our own visualizations based on W.E.B. Dubois' famous visualizations from the 1900 Paris Exposition. The code used to generate all this can be found in dubois/GOODWIN-source-code.html and some notes about it can be found in dubois/GOODWIN-figure-notes.pdf.

### [Migration Recreation](portfolio.lizgood.win/assets/american-economic-mobility/dubois/lot-11931-no-08-GOODWIN.jpg)
This recreates it almost exactly but using the full 1900 census instead. 

### [Demographics Recreation](portfolio.lizgood.win/assets/american-economic-mobility/dubois/lot-11931-no-53-GOODWIN.jpg)
This recreates a population pyramid he made, but this time using modern data. 

### [Original (Inspired)](portfolio.lizgood.win/assets/american-economic-mobility/dubois/original-GOODWIN.jpg)
A totally modern graphic I made in the same project. 


## Term Paper

A paper on the regional demographic and mobility trends in Virginia. Very similar to the dataset used on the bayesian model above, this is the first paper I used it with. Basically analysis of linked census microdata from 17th century full count decennial censuses. The paper can be found at term_paper/term_paper.pdf and the code can be found at term_paper/detailed_dive_code.qmd
